              This is Hugo, a front-end developer with a passion for learning and
            problem-solving. I fell in love with coding while collaborating
              with programmers at the Watch Tower Bible and Tract Society of
              Canada, after which I decided to make it a career. I look forward
              to contributing to new solutions and growing in the industry
