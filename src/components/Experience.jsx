                We build and maintain websites for small and medium businesses.
                While collaborating with their team, I learned valuable lessons,
                but I quickly realised that working with them was not going to
                help meÂ achieve my goal of becoming a software developer because
                they only work with paid themes and drag and build programmes
                like Elementor.

                Some quick example text to build on the card title and make up
                the bulk of the card's content.
